# Time-to-Impact

Select two objects and see how long it takes them to drift into each other under their own gravity

### Requirements

- python 3
- Tkinter

### Instructions

Run script with python 3 from the terminal. This will open the window shown below. The gui opens with a list of radio options with objects of different sizes to select. Select one from each column and provide a distance between them in the third column. After clicking 'Submit', the gui provides the time for both objects to collide under the influence of gravity. Change objects and distance as many times as you'd like. Or use the 'custom' option to imput your own masses.
